# Mi Portfolio

[Watch me here!](https://miguelanguai.github.io/)

I want to make a one-page portfolio that contains the next items (in this
order):

- Header: Here, there is my personal logo and some links for the same page.
- Main: Here, a Work in Progress is firstly displayed to let know the person who
  is taking a look of the portfolio that I'm still on my portfolio. Then, my
  name and my position. After, a little description.
  - Works: This section shows the job experiences I have had, the position I
    have   been at and the programming languages I have used at that job. As,
    for now, I don't have any real experiences, I must say at first I'm still a
    student, but I will write some models where I'll apply my work experiences
    in the future. On this model, I have the job title (which will be the
    position I will be at) and the Languages I will use at that position.
  - About: This section will talk about me as a person, and my way until
    becoming a programmer. Here, I want to point out that I see my portfolio as
    a kind of story-teller, more than just being a simple "interactive CV". I
    also explain what are my hobbies, in order to let the viewer know more about
    me.
  - Projects: This section will show which projects I have been working on. As
    I'm   still a student, I will show the projects I have done as a student,
    because, for now, I just have those ones. First one is the project I did
    with my team in the hackathon we participated early this year, and the final
    project I did with a classmate last year in programming module. On every
    project, I explain how they work and which technologies they use.
  - Stack: This section shows the Stack I have for now. My idea is to create a
    carousel in order to make it more eye-catching.
  - Blog: This section will show my Linkedin profile posts (the three most
    recent). For now, they are directly written on HTML file, but I want to use
    (if exists) an API to take these posts automatically from my Linkedin
    profile everytime my portfolio is opened.
  - Contact: This contact section will provide the user 3 links to my main
    professional social media profiles: GitHub, LinkedIn and a link to send me
    an email.
  - Chat: This section, although is operative now, it's not "cool" for the
    moment. This will be a "fake" chat, created to make user able to "talk" with
    an interactive window that will bring him/her the information he/she wants.
    But, in order to make it work correctly, I will need to apply CSS and JS.
    So, it's there, although is not useful for now.
- Footer: Here, social media icons are again displayed here and also there is a
  text about the Copyright.

This will be my portfolio (for now, the HTML)

*Note: Some featurings I want to add are added in HTML only, but the intention
is to apply CSS and JS to make them visual and functional. They are commented
with "Future Feat:"

*Note: I wanted to apply "All rights reserved" in my portfolio, but as the
project asks for a License, I haven't seen any license with "All rights
reserved", and as I have read the thread "otro: Como atribuir correctamente
código que no es mío" in outlook forum, I have to change "Copyright © 2023
Miguel Ángel Guaita. All rights reserved." to "Copyright 2023 Miguel Ángel
Guaita"
