# Mi Portfolio

[Watch me here!](https://miguelanguai.github.io/)

My portfolio now is better than in first semester. There are a lot of thing I
would like to add, but I have no more time to do it. But, for now, I have a
basic interface I can work with and develop it little by little. My main focus
here was doing it visual and, although I'm new in UI/UX and my interface is not
really cute, I think the final result was fine.
I couldn't resolve some problems related to the interface vision in Github Pages
in mobile devices (the links are still underlined and in blue color). 
With all that, I have thought in mobile interfaces and smaller viewports, the
text layout and have added fonts, although I'm not sure if I have added them
well.
