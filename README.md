# Mi Portfolio

I want to make a one-page portfolio that contains the next items (in this
order):

- Works: This section shows the job experiences I have had, the position I have
  been at and the programming languages I have used at that job
- About: This section will talk about me as a person, and my way until the
  moment I'm right now as a programmer. My career before becoming a programmer
  and my career from the moment I became a programmer
- Projects: This section will show which projects I have been working on. As I'm
  still a student, I will show the projects I have done as a student, because,
  for now, I just have those ones.
- Blog: This section will show interesting things I want to share with the
  people is going to take a look at my Portfolio. I'm thinking on bringing my
  LinkedIn's profile publications here, although I'm not sure about how doing
  it.
- Contact: This section will be meant for the ways of contacting with me. But it
  won't be a typical contact window with the links to my social media (this
  will be at the footer too). It will be a false-AI that will show some options
  of message for the user, and, depending on the choice, it will show different
  social media.*

This will be my portfolio (for now, the HTML)

*The only thing about the false-AI is that, I will need to wait until I know JS
to develop that code. Just with HTML it can't be done..
